##Documentation for GitHub Repo Files This documentation provides a description of the different files in a GitHub repository and their contents. ### ProducerListener.scala - File Name: ProducerListener.scala - Package: producer This file contains the definition of the `ProducerListener` class, which is an Akka actor. It listens for messages and creates and sends messages to a producer actor. The file includes the following methods: 1. `randomString`: This method generates a random string of a specified length. 2. `receive`: This method defines the behavior of the actor when it receives messages. It handles two types of messages: `SendCreate` and `Connected`. ### Producer.scala - File Name: Producer.scala - Package: producer This file contains the definition of the `Producer` class, which is an Akka actor. It interacts with the TCP connection and sends messages to a remote address. The file includes the following methods: 1. `props`: This method creates and returns the `Props` configuration for creating a new `Producer` actor. 2. `receive`: This method defines the behavior of the actor when it receives messages. It handles different types of messages related to the TCP connection and message sending. ### main.scala - File Name: main.scala - Package: main This file contains the main entry point for the application. It sets up the Actor System, defines the topic list, and creates instances of various actors such as `ConsumerListener`, `Consumer`, `ProducerListener`, and `Producer`. The file includes the following parts: 1. Import statements: Importing required dependencies and classes. 2. Variable declarations: Declaring variables for the topic list and actors. 3. Scheduling: Scheduling periodic actions using the `scheduler` of the actor system. ### ConsumerListener.scala - File Name: ConsumerListener.scala - Package: consumer This file contains the definition of the `ConsumerListener` class, which is an Akka actor. It handles received messages, subscribes to topics, and manages subscribed topics. The file includes the following methods: 1. `receive`: This method defines the behavior of the actor when it receives messages. It handles messages related to received messages, subscribing, and unsubscribing. ### Consumer.scala - File Name: Consumer.scala - Package: consumer This file contains the definition of the `Consumer` class, which is an Akka actor. It interacts with the TCP connection and handles messages received from the connection. The file includes the following methods: 1. `props`: This method creates and returns the `Props` configuration for creating a new `Consumer` actor. 2. `receive`: This method defines the behavior of the actor when it receives messages. It handles different types of messages related to the TCP connection and message handling. Please note that this documentation provides an overview of the file names, packages, and their contents. For more details and specific implementations, refer to the respective files in the GitHub repository.
